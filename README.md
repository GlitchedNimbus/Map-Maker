# Map-Maker
This is a personal project that I had decided to work on in my spare time.

I am currently working on the algorithm to generate and place the hallways so that all rooms are connected.

GUI is implemented using Swing and is at this point strictly for visual testing of the room placement algorithm.

Placement at this point isn't an algortihm, more like throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.

Hallways will be added based upon a set containing minimum edges required to connect all rooms, 
with added edges created from a referance set.

All of the code is rough and will be cleaned up as the project progresses.

Any and all criticism is welcome, I would love to hear opinions on how I can make this project better.

A way to populate the dungeon with randomly generated monsters will be implemented after the maker is running smoothly.
